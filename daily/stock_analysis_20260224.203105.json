Economically, this bolsters the AI sector's growth trajectory, potentially adding billions to data center spending by hyperscalers.

Historical parallel: Similar to the GPU boom during crypto mining in 2017-2018, where NVDA surged 10x. Analogies: 1) Like oil during industrialization fueling engine makers; 2) Electricity for modern computing transformers.",
